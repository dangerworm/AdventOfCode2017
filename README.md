# AdventOfCode2017
This is my work so far on the Advent of Code 2017 challenges.

For me the goal has been to learn more about (and experiment with) Python's 
syntax and internal structures, so although some of the code may not be 
'best practice' it's written like that because I was seeing what I could do.

The code is still readable and I suppose in many ways it shows my thinking,
but I haven't spent the time I know some people have making them the most
optimised and efficient they can possibly be. I'll probably come back and 
do that at some point but for now it's just a bit of fun.
